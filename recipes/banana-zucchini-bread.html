    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This banana zucchini bread combines two of my favorites: banana walnut bread and zucchini bread. I like to add dried cranberries for an extra boost of flavor in every bite.

    <p>
        This banana zucchini bread is moist and subtly sweet. Plus, it's a great way to sneak healthy ingredients into a crowd-pleasing treat!
